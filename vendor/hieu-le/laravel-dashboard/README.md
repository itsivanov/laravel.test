# Laravel Dashboard

A layout for the dashboards of Laravel 5 applications

## Installation

Register the package as your project dependency

    $> composer require hieu-le/laravel-dashboard
    
Add the package service provider to your `providers` array inside the `config/app.php` file.

    HieuLe\LaravelDashboard\LaravelDashboardServiceProvider::class,
    
## AdminLTE

I use the famous [AdminLTE](//almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html) theme with this package. I suggest to read its documentation and examples to understand the HTML structure of Laravel Dashboard more.

## Demo and usage

Visit the [demo website](https://laravel-dashboard.hieule.info/).
